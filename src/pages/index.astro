      <h2>The Thai alphabet uses a different set of rules than English does</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Capital letters are not used in the Thai language</li>
        <li>
          The alphabet has 44 consonants, some of which can be combined with
          other letters to form more complex sounds
        </li>
        <li>
          The vowels have accents over them to show how they should be
          pronounced.
        </li>
        <li>
          In Thai there are no spaces between words so it looks like one long
          string of letters when typed out.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Thai is a tonal language—that means that the pitch of your voice can
        change the meaning of a word in Thai. For example, อยาก (yàak) means
        “want to” but ไม่อยาก (mái yàak) means “do not want to.” This makes
        reading Thai very difficult for people who aren't used to seeing this
        style of writing!
      </p>
      <p>
        To make it easier, we gathered some links and tools that can help you
        learn to read Thai in no time.

      <h2>There is actually an app based on the Manee books</h2>
      <p>
        Easy Thai Read is an app for all ages. It is in fact a digital version
        of the Manee study books for childen. It has voice recordings from a
        native Thai speaker with english translations and its phonetics spelled
        out. At first some Thai words can be quite tricky to read, but once you
        get used to hearing them out at reading them at the same time it gets
        easier over time. There is a comprehensive set of lessons that will
        guide you to more and more difficult words, all the way to the end of a
        book. The lessons are suitable for all ages.
